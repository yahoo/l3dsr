These packages supply the dsrtools software that provides control
of L2DSR and L3DSR VIPs.

Consult the 'Requires' and 'BuildRequires' entries in the "rpm/dsrtools.spec" regarding the prerequisites. On RHEL systems, you may find useful to yum groupinstall "Development Tools" (and "RPM Development Tools" on rhel8).

To build the software, type:

    $ make

For RPM-based distros, to build the source package, type:

    $ make rpm-spkg

For RPM-based distros, to build the binary package, type:

    $ make rpm-pkgs

The RPMs will be under:

    $ ls -lR `rpm -E %_topdir`/{RPMS,SRPMS}

You may want to override %_topdir by setting the make macro TOPDIR:

    $ make TOPDIR=$PWD/topdir rpm-spkg rpm-pkgs


If you have mock installed, type:

    $ make mock-pkgs

You may want to add the macro definition MOCK="sudo mock" to the line.

The RPMs will be in:

    $ ls -lR mock/results_*/*.rpm


If you want to build packages for a system using something other
than the provided "rpm" or "mock", you can create your own directory
and add your packaging files there then provide the directory to the
Makefile to call it with the PPS make macro.  For example, if your
directory is "deb", you could call it with:

    $ make PPS=deb deb-pkgs

If you are happy with your efforts, please submit a pull request to
include your new files in the repository.

If you need to provide new make macros or change the default settings
for existing ones, you may optionally provide at the top level a
"package-local.mk" file which will be automatically included by
subdirectory Makefiles.

With the PPS macro and "package-local.mk", these should substantially
reduce the need to modify provided files when building source or
packages for your environment.
