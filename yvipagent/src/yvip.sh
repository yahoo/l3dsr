# This is an old-fashioned rc-style startup script to configure a host for
# participation in any VIPs.
#
# Since this script may be used on various platforms, we can't take
# advantage of all the neat rc(8) goodness that FreeBSD 6.x (and higher)
# comes with, so we cobble the required functionality together ourselves.
